# Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes' theorem, where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. Unlike frequentist methods, Bayesian statistics allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and provides a natural framework for updating beliefs as new data becomes available.

Bayesian statistics offers a powerful and flexible framework for statistical inference and decision-making under uncertainty. By mastering these concepts and techniques, you'll be able to tackle complex problems with a principled approach to incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs based on observed data.

In the next section, we'll explore [Time Series Analysis](08_time_series_analysis.md), which focuses on analyzing data points collected over time to extract meaningful statistics and characteristics.
